# bore-client-deno

[bore](https://github.com/ekzhang/bore) client for Deno.

## Usage

See `example.ts` for the example.

## Requirement

For now, this package internally executes `bore` command, so the CLI tool should
be installed. Perhaps we will reimplement `bore` protocol in pure Deno in the
future.
